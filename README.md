# Verbos
	An Open Source project for automated video translator system.
	This project is a thesis project which should allow to create an automated video translation system using 
	Machine Learning, Deep Learning and related. The input should be a Video in a given language 
	(for example 'English'), and the output should be in another different language (for example 'French'). 
	The output should keep the images in the original video, but automatically translate the speech.
	
## Proposal for the project

### Domain Background
Dozen of years ago, with the coming of internet the use of video for information change generalized. Videos are present in several various domain : academic, professional, but also for the public. But this is not hasardous. Indeed, several keen studies showed that using of video allows a cognitive worth for their users, unlike a simple reading. 

"The using of video as an illustration item, for instance, leads to bring to learning a dimension more close to reality because a situation which is complex to describe could be more understandable using a presentation of fix images or animated sequences" (De Li√®vre et al., 2000)[See Here](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/ssf/tous-les-numeros/septembre-2012/le-ssf-veille/pourquoi-utiliser-la-video-en-formation/).

The fact that information shared via this method are universal lead to invention of subtitle allowing to a huge number of abroad internet users to follow videos that are broadcast in foreign languages. Obviously this allow to reach a more wide range of stakeholders including those who accept to read subtitles. But we must acknowledge that this methode is annoying, specifically for long hours of video.

So to increase the chances for a user to understand a video displayed in a foreign language, why do not invent an automated video translation system which would translate instantly (or almost instantly) the displayed video, in its desired language. 
As consequence, this could lead to an immediate clear enhancement of the cognitive abilities of the subtitle video readers.
A such system should also take into account the different possibilities of interaction with human cognition, with the intention to increase people learning abilities according to the final result.



### Project Objectives
The main objective for this project is to create a system which ensures an automated voice translation of a video from a given language to another one, different from the input video.
Then, this should be useful to several subojectives to define.
