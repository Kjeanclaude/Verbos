# Verbos
	An Open Source project for automated video translator system.
	This project is a thesis project which should allow to create an automated video translation system using 
	Machine Learning, Deep Learning and related. The input should be a Video in a given language 
	(for example 'English'), and the output should be in another different language (for example 'French'). 
	The output should keep the images in the original video, but automatically translate the speech.
	
## Proposal for the project

### Domain Background
Dozen of years ago, with the coming of internet the use of video for information change generalized. Videos are present in several various domain : academic, professional, but also for the public. But this is not hasardous. Indeed, several keen studies showed that using of video allows a cognitive worth for their users, unlike a simple reading. 

"The using of video as an illustration item, for instance, leads to bring to learning a dimension more close to reality because a situation which is complex to describe could be more understandable using a presentation of fix images or animated sequences" (De Li√®vre et al., 2000)[See Here](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/ssf/tous-les-numeros/septembre-2012/le-ssf-veille/pourquoi-utiliser-la-video-en-formation/)
